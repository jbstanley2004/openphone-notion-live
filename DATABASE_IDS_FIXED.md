# ✅ Database IDs Fixed!

## Issue #3: Incorrect Notion Database IDs

### Problem
The database IDs in the configuration were pointing to different databases than the actual ones you wanted to use.

**Old (Incorrect) IDs:**
- Calls: `9fafb0d4-0d34-4045-af43-cfa8202b962a`
- Messages: `8449ab08-2767-4095-9965-1df389cd8f90`

**New (Correct) IDs:**
- Calls: `fd2b189c-dfc4-4f46-813d-4035960e7e15`
- Messages: `40e7c635-6ce0-46a1-86cf-095801399fc8`

### Solution
✅ Extracted correct IDs from your Notion URLs
✅ Updated secrets in Cloudflare
✅ Redeployed worker

---

## 🎯 Current Status

**Worker Version:** Latest (with correct database IDs)
**Webhook Receiving:** ✅ Working (receiving events successfully)
**Queue Processing:** ✅ Working

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Share Databases with Integration

**You MUST complete this step for Notion pages to be created!**

### For Each Database:

1. **Calls Database:**
   - Open: https://www.notion.so/fd2b189cdfc44f46813d4035960e7e15
   - Click **"⋯"** menu → **"Connections"**
   - Add your integration

2. **Messages Database:**
   - Open: https://www.notion.so/40e7c6356ce046a186cf095801399fc8
   - Click **"⋯"** menu → **"Connections"**
   - Add your integration

**Your integration token:** `ntn_66898179631b...`

## 🧪 Testing After Sharing Databases

1. Send a text message to (336) 518-5544
2. Wait 5-10 seconds
3. Check your Messages database in Notion
4. You should see a new entry!

---

## 📊 What We've Seen So Far

From the logs, the system is working correctly:

```
✅ Webhook received: message.received event
✅ Event queued successfully
✅ Queue consumer will process it
```

The queue consumer is running and will attempt to create the Notion page. If the databases are shared with your integration, it will succeed. If not, you'll see permission errors in the logs.

---

## 🔍 Monitor Processing

```bash
npm run tail
```

Look for:
- ✅ "Creating message page in Notion" - Attempting to create page
- ✅ "Message page created" - Success!
- ❌ "401" or "403" errors - Database not shared with integration

---

## 📝 Summary

All technical issues have been resolved:
- ✅ OpenPhone API key fixed
- ✅ Notion SDK replaced with fetch-based client
- ✅ Database IDs corrected

**Final Step:** Share your Notion databases with the integration (see above)

Once that's done, the system will automatically create pages in Notion for all calls and messages! 🎉
