# ✅ Database IDs Corrected

## The Problem Was Found

Your databases were labeled backwards:
- What you called "Messages" database actually has **Call** properties
- What you called "Calls" database actually has **Message** properties

## What I Did

I queried your actual Notion databases and discovered:

### Database 40e7c635-6ce0-46a1-86cf-095801399fc8
**Has these properties:** Call ID, Direction, Status, Duration, Participants, Recording URL, Transcript, etc.
**This is the CALLS database**

### Database fd2b189c-dfc4-4f46-813d-4035960e7e15
**Has these properties:** Message ID, From, To, Content, Has Media, Media URLs, etc.
**This is the MESSAGES database**

## Corrected Configuration

I swapped the database IDs:
- `NOTION_CALLS_DATABASE_ID` → `40e7c635-6ce0-46a1-86cf-095801399fc8`
- `NOTION_MESSAGES_DATABASE_ID` → `fd2b189c-dfc4-4f46-813d-4035960e7e15`

## Deployed

Worker has been redeployed with the correct mappings.

## Test Now

Send a text message to **(336) 518-5544** and it should create a page in your Messages database (the one at fd2b189c...).

**Status:** Databases correctly mapped. Worker deployed. Ready for testing.
