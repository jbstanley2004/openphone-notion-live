# âœ… API Key Issue RESOLVED

## Problem
The OpenPhone API was returning 401 Unauthorized errors when called from the Cloudflare Worker, even though the API key worked correctly when tested locally with `curl`.

## Root Cause
When setting secrets using `echo`, a newline character was being appended to the API key:
```bash
echo "eCwBlRTGdzepopMViWX3yNEpIoUQ8zEL" | npx wrangler secret put OPENPHONE_API_KEY
# This adds a \n at the end, resulting in: "eCwBlRTGdzepopMViWX3yNEpIoUQ8zEL\n"
```

This caused the Authorization header to be invalid: `Authorization: eCwBlRTGdzepopMViWX3yNEpIoUQ8zEL\n`

## Solution
Used `printf` instead of `echo` to avoid the trailing newline:
```bash
printf "eCwBlRTGdzepopMViWX3yNEpIoUQ8zEL" | npx wrangler secret put OPENPHONE_API_KEY
```

## Verification
Created a debug endpoint `/debug/api-test` that confirmed:
- âœ… API key length: 32 characters (correct)
- âœ… API key prefix: eCwBlRTGdz (correct)
- âœ… OpenPhone API response: 200 OK
- âœ… Successfully retrieved phone number data

## Status
**âœ… FIXED** - The worker is now fully functional and ready to process webhooks!

## Next Steps
1. Configure the OpenPhone webhook (see [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md))
2. Test by making a call or sending a message
3. Check Notion for new entries!
