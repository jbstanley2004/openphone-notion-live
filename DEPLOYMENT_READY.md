# Deployment Ready - All Changes Pushed

## Status: âœ… READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Branch**: `claude/session-011CUYYtfLgwTwyBpQhCqr5g`
**Latest Commit**: `36eb88b` - Fix vectorize configuration

---

## What Was Just Fixed

**Fixed wrangler configuration warning**:
- Removed `dimensions` and `metric` fields from vectorize binding in `wrangler.jsonc`
- These fields caused deployment warnings: "Unexpected fields found in vectorize[0]"
- Fields should be specified during index creation, not in binding configuration
- Configuration now clean and deployment-ready

## Deployment Methods

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Preferred)

Your automatic deployment system should trigger on push to this branch.

**What to check**:
1. Open Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Workers & Pages
2. Look for deployment triggered by commit `36eb88b`
3. Check deployment logs for success/failure

**If automatic deployment isn't configured for this branch**, you'll need to:
- Configure Cloudflare to watch `claude/session-011CUYYtfLgwTwyBpQhCqr5g`
- OR merge this branch into your main deployment branch
- OR use manual deployment (Method 2)

### Method 2: Manual Deployment

If automatic deployment doesn't work, deploy manually:

```bash
# 1. Set your Cloudflare API token
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-token-here"

# 2. Create Vectorize index (first time only)
npx wrangler vectorize create openphone-calls --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine

# 3. Deploy the worker
npx wrangler deploy

# 4. Verify deployment
npx wrangler tail
```

**Get your API token**:
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Create token with "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template
3. Copy token and set as `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Worker Health

```bash
curl https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/health
```

**Expected response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-28T..."
}
```

### 2. View Dashboard

Open browser: `https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/`

**Should show**:
- Live call/message statistics
- AI analysis metrics
- Cache performance data
- Real-time activity feed
- Semantic search interface

### 3. Test Merchant API

```bash
# Get all data for a merchant by phone
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/api/merchant/phone \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+1234567890"}'
```

**Should return**:
- Canvas record
- All calls for that merchant
- All messages for that merchant
- All mail for that merchant
- Combined timeline
- Statistics and insights

### 4. Test Semantic Search

```bash
# Search for merchants discussing pricing
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/api/merchant/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "pricing discussion", "topK": 10}'
```

### 5. Check Logs

```bash
npx wrangler tail
```

**Look for**:
- "Worker deployed successfully"
- Real-time webhook processing
- AI analysis completions
- Vectorization events
- No errors in log stream

---

## What Happens After Deployment

### Immediately (Within Seconds)
1. Worker is live at your worker URL
2. Dashboard accessible at `/`
3. All API endpoints active and responding
4. Real-time webhooks start receiving AI + vectorization
5. Smart caching activates (faster lookups)

### Within 6 Hours (First Cron Run)
1. Scheduled comprehensive backfill triggers
2. Processes last 30 days of all data
3. Applies AI analysis to everything
4. Vectorizes all content for search
5. Reconciles Canvas relations
6. Completes in 30-60 minutes

### After First Backfill (6-12 Hours)
1. All historical calls have AI analysis
2. All historical messages have AI analysis
3. All data vectorized and searchable
4. Canvas relations fully reconciled
5. Merchant retrieval API fully functional

### Every 6 Hours After
1. Backfill runs automatically
2. Catches new/updated data only
3. Keeps everything current
4. Completes in 2-10 minutes

## Configuration Files

### wrangler.jsonc âœ…
```jsonc
{
  "ai": { "binding": "AI" },
  "vectorize": [
    { "binding": "CALL_VECTORS", "index_name": "openphone-calls" }
  ],
  "workflows": [
    { "binding": "CALL_PROCESSING_WORKFLOW", "name": "call-processing-workflow" }
  ],
  "assets": { "directory": "./public", "binding": "ASSETS" },
  "triggers": { "crons": ["0 */6 * * *"] }
}
```

### src/types/env.ts âœ…
```typescript
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;                              // Workers AI
  CALL_VECTORS: Vectorize;             // Vectorize index
  CALL_PROCESSING_WORKFLOW: Fetcher;   // Workflows
  ASSETS: Fetcher;                     // Static assets
  // ... all other bindings
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Vectorize index not found"

**Solution**: Create the index manually:
```bash
npx wrangler vectorize create openphone-calls --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine
```

### Issue: "Workflow not found"

**Solution**: Workflows are deployed with the worker automatically. No manual creation needed.

### Issue: "AI model not available"

**Cause**: Workers AI is not available in your Cloudflare plan
**Solution**: Upgrade to Workers Paid plan (AI models are free after that)

### Issue: "Assets not serving"

**Cause**: Public directory not deployed
**Solution**: Ensure `public/index.html` exists and `npx wrangler deploy` includes assets

### Issue: "Cron not triggering"

**Cause**: Cron triggers only work on deployed workers
**Solution**: Ensure worker is deployed (not just preview). Check Cloudflare Dashboard â†’ Triggers

## Cost Estimates

Based on moderate usage (1000 calls/day):

| Service | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| Workers Compute | 1M requests | $0.50 |
| Workers AI | 10K inferences/day | Free (300K/day limit) |
| Vectorize | 100K queries | $0.004 |
| KV | 10M reads | $0.50 |
| R2 | 100GB storage | $1.50 |
| D1 | 1M rows | Free |
| Queue | 1M ops | $0.40 |
| **Total** | | **~$3/month** |

**Note**: Workers AI is free up to 300K inferences/day on Workers Paid plan.
