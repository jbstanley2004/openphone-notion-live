## ‚úÖ Real-Time Vectorization (ACTIVE)

### Automatic Embedding Creation
Every single call and message is automatically vectorized in real-time:

```typescript
// Happens automatically for EVERY webhook:
1. OpenPhone Webhook ‚Üí Queue
2. AI Analysis (sentiment, summary, action items)
3. Notion Page Created/Updated
4. AUTOMATIC: Generate embeddings via Workers AI
5. AUTOMATIC: Store in Vectorize
6. INSTANT: Available for semantic search
```

### Zero Manual Work
- ‚ùå No batch processing needed
- ‚ùå No cron jobs to run
- ‚ùå No manual indexing
- ‚úÖ Fully automatic from the moment it deploys
- ‚úÖ Real-time indexing as calls come in
- ‚úÖ Immediate search availability

### What You Can Do
```bash
# Search naturally
POST /api/search
{
  "query": "Find all calls about pricing"
}

# Find similar calls (duplicate leads)
POST /api/search
{
  "query": "complaint about service",
  "topK": 10
}

# Search by time range
POST /api/search
{
  "query": "sales opportunities",
  "dateFrom": "2025-10-01",
  "dateTo": "2025-10-27"

## Verification After Deployment

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-worker-url/health
```

Expected:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T..."
}
```

### 2. Dashboard
Open `https://your-worker-url/` in browser to see:
- ‚úÖ Live sync statistics
- ‚úÖ AI analysis metrics
- ‚úÖ Cache performance
- ‚úÖ Semantic search interface
- ‚úÖ Activity log

### 3. API Endpoints
```bash
# Statistics
curl https://your-worker-url/api/stats

# Cache performance
curl https://your-worker-url/api/cache

# Semantic search
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "pricing discussion"}'
```

### 4. Watch First Call Process
```bash
# Tail logs to see real-time processing
npx wrangler tail

# You'll see:
# - "Processing webhook event"
# - "AI analysis completed" (sentiment, lead score)
# - "Canvas cache hit/miss"
# - "Call indexed in Vectorize"
# - "Webhook event processed successfully"
```

## What Happens to Historical Data

### New Calls (From Now On):
‚úÖ **Automatically vectorized** as webhooks arrive
‚úÖ **Immediate search availability**
‚úÖ **Full AI analysis** included

### Existing Historical Calls:
The scheduled backfill task (runs every 6 hours) will:
1. Fetch any calls not yet synced
2. Process through full pipeline
3. AI analysis applied
4. Vectorized automatically
5. Added to searchable index

**Result**: Over time, all historical calls will be vectorized and searchable.
