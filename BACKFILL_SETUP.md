# ✅ Database IDs Updated and Backfill Ready

## Database IDs Set

All 4 Notion database IDs have been updated with the correct values from your URLs:

| Database | ID | Status |

## What Gets Backfilled

The comprehensive backfill processes ALL 4 databases:

### 1. Canvas Database ✅
- **What**: All merchant records
- **Fields**: Company name, phone, email, contact info
- **Purpose**: Source of truth for merchant data

### 2. Calls Database with AI + Vectorization ✅
- **What**: All phone calls from last 30 days
- **AI Analysis**: 
  - Sentiment (DistilBERT)
  - Summary (BART)
  - Action items (GPT-OSS-120B)
  - Category (GPT-OSS-120B)
  - Lead scoring
- **Vectorization**: YES - embedded into Vectorize for semantic search
- **Canvas Relation**: Automatically linked by phone number

### 3. Messages Database with AI + Vectorization ✅
- **What**: All SMS/text messages from last 30 days
- **AI Analysis**:
  - Sentiment (DistilBERT)
  - Summary (BART)
  - Action items (GPT-OSS-120B)
  - Category (GPT-OSS-120B)
- **Vectorization**: YES - embedded into Vectorize for semantic search
- **Canvas Relation**: Automatically linked by phone number

### 4. Mail Database ✅
- **What**: All email records from last 30 days
- **Canvas Relation**: Automatically linked by email address
- **Vectorization**: Not needed (emails stored in Notion)

## Vectorize Index Details

**Index Name**: `openphone-calls`
**What's Indexed**:
- ✅ All calls with transcripts/summaries
- ✅ All messages with text content
- **NOT** mail (email body stored in Notion, not Vectorize)
- **NOT** Canvas (merchant info stored in Notion, not Vectorize)

**Why this design**:
- Calls and messages need semantic search ("find all calls about pricing")
- Mail and Canvas are looked up by exact match (email, phone, merchant ID)
- Single Vectorize index keeps costs low and search fast

## How Data is Consolidated Per Merchant

The system links all data to merchants via Canvas relations:

```
Canvas (Merchant fc0e485b...)
  ├── Phone: +1234567890
  ├── Email: merchant@example.com
  │
  ├── Calls (linked by phone)
  │   ├── Call 1 (AI analyzed, vectorized)
  │   ├── Call 2 (AI analyzed, vectorized)
  │   └── Call 3 (AI analyzed, vectorized)
  │
  ├── Messages (linked by phone)
  │   ├── Message 1 (AI analyzed, vectorized)
  │   ├── Message 2 (AI analyzed, vectorized)
  │   └── Message 3 (AI analyzed, vectorized)
  │
  └── Mail (linked by email)
      ├── Email 1
      ├── Email 2
      └── Email 3
```

**Merchant Retrieval API**: 
- `POST /api/merchant/phone` - Get ALL data for merchant by phone
- `POST /api/merchant/email` - Get ALL data for merchant by email
- `POST /api/merchant/canvas` - Get ALL data for merchant by Canvas ID

Returns:
- Canvas record
- All calls (with AI insights)
- All messages (with AI insights)
- All mail
- Combined timeline
- Aggregated statistics

## Backfill Schedule

**Automatic**: Runs every 6 hours via cron (`0 */6 * * *`)

**What happens**:
1. Fetches last 30 days of data from OpenPhone API
2. Runs AI analysis on all calls and messages
3. Creates embeddings and stores in Vectorize
4. Creates/updates Notion pages in all 4 databases
5. Links everything to Canvas via phone/email matching
6. Skips already-processed records

**Manual trigger**: `POST /api/backfill/comprehensive`

## Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Vectorize index created | ✅ Done |
| Worker deployed | ✅ Done |
| Database IDs set | ✅ Done |
| All 4 databases configured | ✅ Done |
| AI models configured | ✅ Done (GPT-OSS-120B, DistilBERT, BART) |
| Backfill code deployed | ✅ Done |
| Cron schedule active | ✅ Done (runs every 6 hours) |

**Next automatic backfill**: Within the next 6 hours

**To trigger now**: 
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/api/backfill/comprehensive
```

---

## Verification

Once backfill runs, verify data:

```bash
# Check a specific merchant by phone
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/api/merchant/phone \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phoneNumber": "+1234567890"}'

# Search semantically across calls/messages
curl -X POST https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/api/merchant/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "pricing discussion", "topK": 10}'
```

Expected response:
- Canvas record for the merchant
- All calls with AI analysis
- All messages with AI analysis
- All mail
- Timeline of all interactions
- Statistics (total calls, messages, mail, etc.)
