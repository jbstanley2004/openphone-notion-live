## Architecture at a Glance

### The 3-Tier Processing Model

```
TIER 1: REAL-TIME (Webhook)
├── OpenPhone API sends webhook
├── index.ts:handleWebhook() receives
├── Validates, deduplicates
└── Queues to WEBHOOK_EVENTS

TIER 2: BATCHED PROCESSING (Queue Consumer)
├── index.ts:queue() processes batch
├── webhook-processor.ts routes events
├── Downloads recordings, uploads to R2
├── Creates/updates Notion pages
└── Logs to D1 for analytics

TIER 3: SCHEDULED BACKFILL (Cron)
├── Runs every 6 hours
├── scheduled-tasks.ts processes
├── Backfills last 24 hours of calls/messages
├── Updates pending transcripts/summaries
└── Generates R2 statistics
```

### The Data Flow

```
OpenPhone Webhooks
    ↓ (real-time events)
KV SYNC_STATE (deduplication, 7 days)
    ↓
WEBHOOK_EVENTS Queue (batched, 10 at a time)
    ↓
OpenPhone API (rate-limited to 10 req/sec)
    ↓
NOTION CANVAS LOOKUP (bottleneck - 1-2 sec per lookup)
    ↓
D1 canvas_cache (persistent cache to speed up)
    ↓
R2 Bucket (recordings, organized by date)
    ↓
Notion Databases (Calls, Messages, Canvas, Mail)
    ↓
D1 Analytics (sync_history, performance_metrics)
```

## Key Insights

### 1. Durable Objects Are Working Well
The system already uses per-phone Durable Objects for:
- In-memory Canvas caching
- State persistence (last sync times)
- Running totals (calls/messages synced)

The optimization is to make them process calls in parallel instead of sequentially.

### 2. Canvas Lookup is the Primary Bottleneck
- Every new call participant requires a Notion query
- Multiple format attempts (XXX-XXX-XXXX, XXXXXXXXXX, +1XXXXXXXXXX)
- Both phone_number AND rich_text field searches
- In-memory Durable Object cache helps but not persistent
- Solution: Add D1 persistent cache

### 3. Queue Processing Could Be Faster
- Batch size of 10 is conservative (could be 20-50)
- Recording downloads are sequential (could be 3-4 parallel)
- R2 uploads could stream instead of buffer
- Notion API calls could be batched

### 4. The Schema is Well-Designed
D1 tables are appropriate:
- phone_numbers: Track per-phone sync state
- sync_history: Audit trail with proper indexes
- canvas_cache: Persistent caching table
- performance_metrics: Monitoring and optimization

---

## Expected Improvements

After implementing all optimizations:
- **Canvas Lookups**: 5-10x faster (from persistent cache)
- **Call Sync**: 3-5x faster (parallel processing + batch writes)
- **Webhook Processing**: 2-3x faster (parallel downloads, bigger batches)
- **Overall**: 50-70% reduction in average processing time
- **Reliability**: Maintained or improved (better error handling)

---

## Configuration Details

### Current Setup
- **Queue**: 10 messages per batch, 30s timeout, 3 retries
- **Cron**: Every 6 hours
- **KV TTL**: 7 days (events), 30 days (sync state)
- **R2**: YYYY/MM/DD directory structure
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 req/sec (OpenPhone API limit)

### Recommended Adjustments
- **Queue**: Increase to 25 messages per batch (test up to 50)
- **Cron**: Consider every 4 hours (faster backfill)
- **D1 Indexes**: Add index on canvas_cache.hit_count
- **Notion Rate Limiting**: Add explicit rate limiter

---

## Debugging & Monitoring

### Available Debug Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /debug/canvas` - Test Canvas lookup (requires phone or email)
- `GET /debug/schema` - Inspect database schema

### Logging
- All logs are structured JSON
- LOG_LEVEL in wrangler.jsonc (currently "info")
- Includes request ID, webhook event ID, resource ID, etc.

### Key Metrics to Track
- Canvas lookup cache hit ratio (target: 70%+)
- Processing time per call (target: <1s)
- Queue throughput (target: 50+ calls/sec)
- Notion API response time (target: <500ms p95)

   - Follow the 4-phase roadmap
   - Test in preview before production
   - Monitor closely after each change
