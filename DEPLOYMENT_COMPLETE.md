## 📝 Configuration Files

### Updated Files
- ✅ `wrangler.jsonc` - Updated with all resource IDs
- ✅ `.dev.vars.example` - Contains your API keys (for reference)

### Secrets (Not in Git)
All sensitive data is stored securely in Cloudflare:
- Secrets are encrypted at rest
- Not accessible via API
- Can only be updated, not read

## 🎯 How It Works

```
OpenPhone Event
      ↓
   Webhook
      ↓
Cloudflare Worker (receives webhook)
      ↓
Queue (WEBHOOK_EVENTS)
      ↓
Queue Consumer (processes event)
      ↓
OpenPhone API (fetch full data)
      ↓
R2 Storage (save recordings) + Notion API (create/update pages)
```

### Scheduled Tasks
Every 15 minutes, the worker:
1. Backfills recent data (last 24 hours)
2. Updates pending transcripts/summaries
3. Cleans up old cache entries

---

## 💰 Cost Estimate

Based on Workers Paid plan:
- **Workers:** $5/month base + $0.50/million requests ≈ $5-10/month
- **R2 Storage:** $0.015/GB/month ≈ $1-5/month (depends on recordings)
- **KV:** Free tier covers typical usage ≈ $0-2/month
- **Queues:** Included in Workers Paid ≈ $0/month

**Total Estimate:** $10-20/month

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhooks Not Received
**Check:**
1. Verify webhook URL in OpenPhone dashboard
2. Check worker logs: `npm run tail`
3. Test manually: `curl -X POST https://openphone-notion-sync.jstanley82.workers.dev/webhooks/openphone -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test":true}'`

### Issue: Notion Pages Not Created
**Check:**
1. Verify Notion API key is valid
2. Ensure databases are shared with your Notion integration
3. Check database IDs are correct
4. View logs for Notion API errors

### Issue: Recordings Not Uploaded
**Check:**
1. R2 bucket exists: `npx wrangler r2 bucket list`
2. Check logs for R2 errors
3. Verify recording URLs are accessible

### Issue: Rate Limit Errors
**Check:**
1. OpenPhone rate limit is 10 req/sec (worker respects this)
2. View queue metrics for backlog
3. Consider spreading backfill over longer periods

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ All secrets stored securely in Cloudflare
- ✅ API keys not committed to git
- ✅ Webhook signature validation supported (optional)
- ✅ Rate limiting enabled
- ✅ Error tracking and logging enabled

**Recommendation:** Rotate API keys regularly for security.
