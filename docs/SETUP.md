3. Select "Add connections"
4. Find your "OpenPhone Sync" integration
5. Click "Connect"

### 1.5 Get Database IDs

For **each database**:

1. Open the database in full page mode
2. Copy the URL from your browser
3. Extract the database ID:
   ```
   https://www.notion.so/myworkspace/abcd1234efgh5678ijkl?v=...
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                     This is your database ID
   ```
4. Save both IDs:
   - Calls Database ID: `________`
   - Messages Database ID: `________`

---

## Step 2: OpenPhone Setup

### 2.1 Generate API Key

1. Log in to OpenPhone at https://app.openphone.com
2. Click your workspace name → Settings
3. Navigate to **API** tab (requires Owner/Admin role)
4. Click "Generate API key"
5. Give it a label: "Notion Sync"
6. **Copy the API key** (starts with `sk_` or similar)
7. Save this key securely - you cannot retrieve it later

### 2.2 Verify API Access

Test your API key:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.openphone.com/v1/phone-numbers
```

You should get a JSON response with your phone numbers.

### 2.3 Note Your Phone Numbers

Make note of which OpenPhone numbers you want to sync. The integration will sync ALL numbers by default.

---

## Step 3: Cloudflare Setup

### 3.1 Install Wrangler CLI

```bash
npm install -g wrangler

# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login
```

### 3.2 Clone and Install Project

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd openphone-notion-sync
npm install
```

### 3.3 Create KV Namespaces

Run these commands and **save the IDs** output:

```bash
# SYNC_STATE
wrangler kv:namespace create "SYNC_STATE"
wrangler kv:namespace create "SYNC_STATE" --preview

# RATE_LIMITS
wrangler kv:namespace create "RATE_LIMITS"
wrangler kv:namespace create "RATE_LIMITS" --preview

# CACHE
wrangler kv:namespace create "CACHE"
wrangler kv:namespace create "CACHE" --preview
```

Example output:
```
{ binding = "SYNC_STATE", id = "abc123...", preview_id = "xyz789..." }
```

### 3.4 Update wrangler.jsonc

Edit `wrangler.jsonc` and replace the placeholder IDs:

```jsonc
{
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "SYNC_STATE",
      "id": "your_actual_id_here",
      "preview_id": "your_actual_preview_id_here"
    },
    {
      "binding": "RATE_LIMITS",
      "id": "your_actual_id_here",
      "preview_id": "your_actual_preview_id_here"
    },
    {
      "binding": "CACHE",
      "id": "your_actual_id_here",
      "preview_id": "your_actual_preview_id_here"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.5 Create R2 Buckets

```bash
# Production bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create openphone-recordings

# Development bucket
wrangler r2 bucket create openphone-recordings-dev
```

### 3.6 Configure Secrets

Create local `.dev.vars` file:

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

Edit `.dev.vars`:

```ini
OPENPHONE_API_KEY=sk_your_openphone_key_here
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_your_notion_key_here
NOTION_CALLS_DATABASE_ID=your_calls_database_id_here
NOTION_MESSAGES_DATABASE_ID=your_messages_database_id_here
RECORDINGS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://pub-358b252982f749d78ef2628cb2b3450b.r2.dev
SELF_PHONE_NUMBERS=["+13365195544"]
RECORDINGS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://media.yourdomain.com
```

Set production secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put OPENPHONE_API_KEY
# Paste your key when prompted

wrangler secret put NOTION_API_KEY
# Paste your key when prompted

wrangler secret put NOTION_CALLS_DATABASE_ID
# Paste your database ID when prompted

wrangler secret put NOTION_MESSAGES_DATABASE_ID
# Paste your database ID when prompted
```

If your R2 bucket is fronted by a public domain, set `RECORDINGS_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` in `wrangler.jsonc` (or `.dev.vars` for
local development) to the HTTPS origin that serves uploaded recordings. For this project, use
`https://pub-358b252982f749d78ef2628cb2b3450b.r2.dev`. When omitted, the worker automatically generates Workers Signed
URLs using `createSignedUrl`.

List any internal OpenPhone numbers in `SELF_PHONE_NUMBERS` so the sync can ignore them. This deployment should include
`+1 (336) 519-5544`, which is expressed as `["+13365195544"]` in the `.dev.vars` example above.
local development) to the HTTPS origin that serves uploaded recordings. When omitted, the worker automatically generates
Workers Signed URLs using `createSignedUrl`.

## Step 4: Deploy Worker

### 4.1 Test Locally (Optional)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:8787/health - should return:
```json
{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

### 4.2 Deploy to Production

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Expected output:
```
Total Upload: ... KiB
Uploaded openphone-notion-sync (1.23 sec)
Published openphone-notion-sync (0.45 sec)
  https://openphone-notion-sync.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

**Save your Worker URL!**

### 4.3 Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/health

# View logs
npm run tail
```

---

## Step 5: Configure Webhooks

### 5.1 Create Webhook in OpenPhone

1. Go to OpenPhone Settings → API → Webhooks
2. Click "Create Webhook"
3. Configure:
   - **URL**: `https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/webhooks/openphone`
   - **Events**: Select ALL:
     - ☑️ call.ringing
     - ☑️ call.completed
     - ☑️ call.recording.completed
     - ☑️ call.transcript.completed
     - ☑️ call.summary.completed
     - ☑️ message.received
     - ☑️ message.delivered
4. Click "Create"
5. **Test the webhook** using OpenPhone's test button

### 5.2 Verify Webhook

OpenPhone should show "Webhook test successful" or similar.

Check your Worker logs:
```bash
npm run tail
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Received webhook",
  "eventId": "EV...",
  "eventType": "..."
}
```

---

## Step 6: Verify Installation

### 6.1 Make a Test Call

1. Make a test call using OpenPhone
2. Wait for it to complete
3. Check Worker logs:
   ```bash
   npm run tail
   ```
4. Look for:
   - "Received webhook"
   - "Processing webhook event"
   - "Call page created in Notion"

### 6.2 Check Notion Database

1. Open your Calls database in Notion
2. You should see a new entry with:
   - Call ID
   - Duration
   - Timestamps
   - Participant phone numbers

### 6.3 Send a Test Message

1. Send a test SMS via OpenPhone
2. Check Messages database in Notion
3. Verify message content appears

### 6.4 Verify Recordings (if available)

If your test call had a recording:

1. Check R2 bucket:
   ```bash
   wrangler r2 object list openphone-recordings --prefix recordings/
   ```
2. Verify Recording URL in Notion is populated
3. Try accessing the URL (may need R2 public access configured)

### 6.5 Check Analytics

View in Cloudflare Dashboard:
1. Workers & Pages → openphone-notion-sync
2. Click "Metrics" tab
3. Verify requests are being processed

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Working

**Symptoms**: No logs, no Notion pages created

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Worker URL is correct in OpenPhone
2. Check Worker is deployed: `curl https://your-url/health`
3. Test webhook manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-url/webhooks/openphone \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"id":"TEST","type":"call.completed","createdAt":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","data":{"object":{}}}'
   ```
4. Check Worker logs for errors

### Notion Pages Not Creating

**Symptoms**: Webhook received but no Notion pages

**Solutions**:
1. Verify Notion API key: Test with:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/YOUR_DB_ID/query \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_NOTION_KEY" \
        -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28"
   ```
2. Verify database IDs are correct
3. Ensure databases are shared with integration
4. Check Worker logs for Notion API errors

### Rate Limit Errors

**Symptoms**: "Rate limit exceeded" in logs

**Solutions**:
1. System should auto-retry with backoff
2. If persistent, reduce cron frequency
3. Contact OpenPhone for rate limit increase

### Missing Historical Data

**Symptoms**: Old calls/messages not in Notion

**Solutions**:
1. Manually trigger backfill:
   ```bash
   wrangler triggers schedule openphone-notion-sync
   ```
2. Adjust backfill window in `src/processors/scheduled-tasks.ts`
3. Run multiple times for older data
